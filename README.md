- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HermesZum and my name is Clemente Nogueira.
- :house: I'm a full stack developer from Portugal.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in freelance work and also learn more.
- ðŸ“« You can contact me at git.3gear@gmail.com. 
- :sparkling_heart: I love computer science. I'm personally convinced that computer science has a lot in common with physics. Both are about how the world works at a fundamental level. The difference, of course, is that while in physics you're supposed to figure out how the world is made up, in computer science you create the world. Within the confines of the computer, you're the creator. You get to control everything that happens.
- :sun_with_face: Imagination, ingenuity, and creation are the three words that make me move in the right way, they are my gear. I have the confidence that everyone can be part of creating a more desirable future, and a process to act when faced with a difficult challenge, and as such, I need and require new perspectives, new tools, and innovative approaches. For these reasons I enjoy learning, know the various techniques and forms of creating the programming and design.
